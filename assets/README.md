# Assets Folder

This folder contains the app assets. For now, placeholder files are needed:

## Required Files:
- `icon.png` (1024x1024) - App icon
- `splash.png` (1284x2778) - Splash screen
- `adaptive-icon.png` (1024x1024) - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` (48x48) - Web favicon

## Temporary Solution:
You can use any PNG files with the correct names for now. The app will still build and run.

To create simple placeholder images, you can:
1. Use any image editor to create colored squares
2. Use online tools like placeholder.com
3. Copy any existing PNG and rename it

For the splash screen background color: #667eea (blue-purple gradient)
